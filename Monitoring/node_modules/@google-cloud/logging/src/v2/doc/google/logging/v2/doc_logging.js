 * The parameters to DeleteLog.
 *
 * @property {string} logName
 *   Required. The resource name of the log to delete:
 *
 *       "projects/[PROJECT_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]"
 *       "organizations/[ORGANIZATION_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]"
 *       "billingAccounts/[BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]"
 *       "folders/[FOLDER_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]"
 *
 *   `[LOG_ID]` must be URL-encoded. For example,
 *   `"projects/my-project-id/logs/syslog"`,
 *   `"organizations/1234567890/logs/cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com%2Factivity"`.
 *   For more information about log names, see
 *   LogEntry.
 *
 * @typedef DeleteLogRequest

/**
 * The parameters to WriteLogEntries.
 *
 * @property {string} logName
 *   Optional. A default log resource name that is assigned to all log entries
 *   in `entries` that do not specify a value for `log_name`:
 *
 *       "projects/[PROJECT_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]"
 *       "organizations/[ORGANIZATION_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]"
 *       "billingAccounts/[BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]"
 *       "folders/[FOLDER_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]"
 *
 *   `[LOG_ID]` must be URL-encoded. For example,
 *   `"projects/my-project-id/logs/syslog"` or
 *   `"organizations/1234567890/logs/cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com%2Factivity"`.
 *   For more information about log names, see
 *   LogEntry.
 *
 * @property {Object} resource
 *   Optional. A default monitored resource object that is assigned to all log
 *   entries in `entries` that do not specify a value for `resource`. Example:
 *
 *       { "type": "gce_instance",
 *         "labels": {
 *           "zone": "us-central1-a", "instance_id": "00000000000000000000" }}
 *
 *   See LogEntry.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [MonitoredResource]{@link google.api.MonitoredResource}
 *
 * @property {Object.<string, string>} labels
 *   Optional. Default labels that are added to the `labels` field of all log
 *   entries in `entries`. If a log entry already has a label with the same key
 *   as a label in this parameter, then the log entry's label is not changed.
 *   See LogEntry.
 *
 * @property {Object[]} entries
 *   Required. The log entries to send to Stackdriver Logging. The order of log
 *   entries in this list does not matter. Values supplied in this method's
 *   `log_name`, `resource`, and `labels` fields are copied into those log
 *   entries in this list that do not include values for their corresponding
 *   fields. For more information, see the LogEntry type.
 *
 *   If the `timestamp` or `insert_id` fields are missing in log entries, then
 *   this method supplies the current time or a unique identifier, respectively.
 *   The supplied values are chosen so that, among the log entries that did not
 *   supply their own values, the entries earlier in the list will sort before
 *   the entries later in the list. See the `entries.list` method.
 *
 *   Log entries with timestamps that are more than the
 *   [logs retention period](https://cloud.google.com/logging/quota-policy) in the past or more than
 *   24 hours in the future might be discarded. Discarding does not return
 *   an error.
 *
 *   To improve throughput and to avoid exceeding the
 *   [quota limit](https://cloud.google.com/logging/quota-policy) for calls to `entries.write`,
 *   you should try to include several log entries in this list,
 *   rather than calling this method for each individual log entry.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [LogEntry]{@link google.logging.v2.LogEntry}
 *
 * @property {boolean} partialSuccess
 *   Optional. Whether valid entries should be written even if some other
 *   entries fail due to INVALID_ARGUMENT or PERMISSION_DENIED errors. If any
 *   entry is not written, then the response status is the error associated
 *   with one of the failed entries and the response includes error details
 *   keyed by the entries' zero-based index in the `entries.write` method.
 *

/**
 * The parameters to `ListLogEntries`.
 *
 * @property {string[]} projectIds
 *   Deprecated. Use `resource_names` instead.  One or more project identifiers
 *   or project numbers from which to retrieve log entries.  Example:
 *   `"my-project-1A"`. If present, these project identifiers are converted to
 *   resource name format and added to the list of resources in
 *   `resource_names`.
 *
 * @property {string[]} resourceNames
 *   Required. Names of one or more parent resources from which to
 *   retrieve log entries:
 *
 *       "projects/[PROJECT_ID]"
 *       "organizations/[ORGANIZATION_ID]"
 *       "billingAccounts/[BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID]"
 *       "folders/[FOLDER_ID]"
 *
 *   Projects listed in the `project_ids` field are added to this list.
 *
 * @property {string} filter
 *   Optional. A filter that chooses which log entries to return.  See [Advanced
 *   Logs Filters](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/advanced_filters).  Only log entries that
 *   match the filter are returned.  An empty filter matches all log entries in
 *   the resources listed in `resource_names`. Referencing a parent resource
 *   that is not listed in `resource_names` will cause the filter to return no
 *   results.
 *   The maximum length of the filter is 20000 characters.
 *
 * @property {string} orderBy
 *   Optional. How the results should be sorted.  Presently, the only permitted
 *   values are `"timestamp asc"` (default) and `"timestamp desc"`. The first
 *   option returns entries in order of increasing values of
 *   `LogEntry.timestamp` (oldest first), and the second option returns entries
 *   in order of decreasing timestamps (newest first).  Entries with equal
 *   timestamps are returned in order of their `insert_id` values.
 *
 * @property {number} pageSize
 *   Optional. The maximum number of results to return from this request.
 *   Non-positive values are ignored.  The presence of `next_page_token` in the
 *   response indicates that more results might be available.
 *
 * @property {string} pageToken
 *   Optional. If present, then retrieve the next batch of results from the
 *   preceding call to this method.  `page_token` must be the value of
 *   `next_page_token` from the previous response.  The values of other method
 *   parameters should be identical to those in the previous call.
