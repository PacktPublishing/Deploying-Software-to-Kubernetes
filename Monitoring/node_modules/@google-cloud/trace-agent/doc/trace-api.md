# The `TraceApi` Object

A `TraceApi` instance provides functions that facilitate the following:

- Creating trace spans and add labels to them.
- Getting information about how the trace agent was configured in the current application.
- Parsing and serializing trace contexts to support distributed tracing between microservices.
- Binding callbacks and event emitters in order to propagate trace contexts across asynchronous boundaries.

In addition to the above, `TraceApi` also provides a number of well-known label keys and constants through its `labels` and `constants` fields respectively.

## Trace Spans

These functions provide the capability to create trace spans, add labels to them, and close them.

* `TraceApi#runInRootSpan(options, fn)`
  * `options`: [`TraceOptions`](#trace-span-options)
  * `fn`: `function(Span): any`
  * Returns `any` (return value of `fn`)
  * Creates a root span and runs the given callback, passing it a `Span` object. In some instances, this `Span` object doesn't correspond to an actual trace span; this can be checked by consulting the value of `Span#type`:
    * `TraceApi#spanTypes.ROOT`: This object corresponds to a real trace span.
    * `TraceApi#spanTypes.UNTRACED`: There isn't a real trace span corresponding to this object, for one of the following reasons:
      * The trace policy, as specified by the user-given configuration, disallows a root span from being created under the current circumstances.
      * The trace agent is disabled, either because it wasn't started at all, started in disabled mode, or encountered an initialization error.
      * The incoming request had headers that explicitly specified that this request shouldn't be traced.
    * `TraceApi#spanTypes.UNCORRELATED`: `runInRootSpan` was called for a request that already has a root span. This likely indicates a programmer error, as nested root spans are not allowed.
  * **Note:** You must call `endSpan` on the span object provided as an argument for the span to be recorded.
* `TraceApi#createChildSpan(options)`
  * `options`: [`TraceOptions`](#trace-span-options)
  * Returns `Span`
  * Creates a child `Span` object and returns it. In some instances, this `Span` object doesn't correspond to an actual trace span; this can be checked by consulting the value of `Span#type`:
    * `TraceApi#spanTypes.CHILD`: This object corresponds to a real trace span.
    * `TraceApi#spanTypes.UNTRACED`: There isn't a real trace span corresponding to this object, because this span's parent is also an `UNTRACED` (root) span.
    * `TraceApi#spanTypes.UNCORRELATED`: There isn't a real trace span corresponding to this object, for one of the following reasons:
      * A root span wasn't created beforehand because `runInRootSpan` was not called at all. This likely indicates a programmer error, because child spans should always be nested within a root span.
      * A root span was created beforehand, but context was lost between then and now. This may also be a programmer error, because child spans should always be created within the context of a root span. See [`Context Propagation`](#context-propagation) for details on properly propagating root span context.
  * **Note:** You must call `endSpan` on the returned span object for the span to be recorded.
* `TraceApi#spanTypes`
  * An enumeration of the types of spans: `ROOT`, `CHILD`, `UNTRACED`, `UNCORRELATED`
* `Span#addLabel(key, value)`
  * `key`: `string`
  * `value`: `any`
  * Add a label to the span associated with the calling object. If the value is not a string, it will be stringified with `util.inspect`.
  * **Note:** Keys and values may be truncated according to the user's configuration and limits set on the Stackdriver Trace API. Keys must be less than 128 bytes, while values must be less than 16 kilobytes, as specified in the [Stackdriver Trace docs][stackdriver-trace-span]. The user may specify a smaller limit on value size through the `maximumLabelValueSize` configuration field.
* `Span#endSpan()`
  * Ends the span associated with the calling object. This function should only be called once.

### Trace Span Options

Some functions above accept a `TraceOptions` object, which has the following fields:

* `name`: `string`
  * Required
  * The name that should be given to the newly created span.
* `traceContext`: `string`
  * Optional for root spans, ignored for child spans
  * A serialized trace context. If the module being traced is a web framework, the plugin that patches this module should attempt to extract this from an incoming request header and set this field; omitting this field may cause trace spans that correspond to a single request across several services in a distributed environment (e.g. microservices) to appear disassociated with one another. See also [Cross-Service Trace Contexts](#cross-service-trace-contexts).
* `url`: `string`
  * Optional for root spans, ignored for child spans
  * The URL of the incoming request. This only applies if the module being traced is a web framework. This field will also be compared against the trace agent's URL filtering policy to check whether a span should be created.
* `skipFrames`: `number`
  * Optional; defaults to `0`
  * Trace spans include the call stack at the moment of creation as part of the information gathered. The call stack may include undesirable frames such as frames within the plugin itself. This field specifies the number of stack frames to skip when writing the call stack to the trace span. Frames within the trace agent implementation are automatically skipped.

## Trace Agent Configuration

* `TraceApi#enhancedDatabaseReportingEnabled()`
  * Returns `boolean`
  * Returns whether the trace agent was started with an enhanced level of reporting. See the [configuration][config-js] object definition for more details.

## Cross-Service Trace Contexts

The Trace Agent can propagate trace context across multiple services. This associates multiple spans that correspond to a single incoming request with each other, and is particularly useful in tracing requests in a microservices-based web application. (For more information, see the [Dapper][dapper-paper] paper describing the distributed tracing system.)

Trace context is sent and received using the [`'x-cloud-trace-context'`][stackdriver-trace-faq] field in HTTP request headers. Built-in plugins automatically read from and write to this field, so for application developers, no additional work is necessary.

### For Incoming Requests

Plugins that trace incoming HTTP requests (in other words, web frameworks) should support cross-service tracing by reading serialized trace context from the `'x-cloud-trace-context'` header, and supplying it as the [`traceContext` option](#trace-span-options) when creating a new root span. The trace agent will automatically deserialize the trace context and associate any new spans with it.

The string `'x-cloud-trace-context'` is provided as `TraceApi#constants.TRACE_CONTEXT_HEADER_NAME`.

It is highly recommended for plugins to set this header field in responses, _if_ the incoming request has this header. The trace context that should be written can be obtained with the following function:

* `TraceApi#getResponseTraceContext(incomingTraceContext, isTraced)`
  * `incomingTraceContext`: `string`
  * `isTraced`: `boolean`
  * Returns `string`
  * Returns a string that should be set in the response headers in a traced request. If incomingTraceContext is falsy (indicating that the incoming request didn't have a trace context), this function returns an empty string.

This function is usually called from within the function passed to `runInRootSpan`. See any of the built-in plugins ([express](../src/plugins/plugin-express.ts)) for an example. Note that the value for `isTraced` is based on the value of the root span - if a root span was created, that means that this request is being traced.

### For Outgoing Requests

Use the following function to obtain the current serialized trace context. The built-in plugin for `http` and `https` does this automatically.

* `Span#getTraceContext()`
  * Returns `string`
  * Gets the trace context serialized as a string.

## Context Propagation

These functions help provide context propagation for root spans. Context should be propagated anywhere control is yielded to the user; this is either through a callback or an emitter. This will enable child spans to be associated with the correct root span.

* `api.wrap(fn)`
  * `fn`: `function`
  * Returns `function` (same signature as `fn`)
  * Binds the given function to the current context.

* `api.wrapEmitter(emitter)`
  * `emitter`: `EventEmitter`
  * Binds any event handlers subsequently attached to the given event emitter to the current context.
