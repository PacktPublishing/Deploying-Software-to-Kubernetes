It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Kubernetes is the new infrastructure. If you understand how to use it, it automatically unlocks the benefits of standard continuous delivery in your apps. We are going to set up a Kubernetes cluster in Google Cloud Platform and deploy software in a CI/CD manner so that we speed up the release cycle in a way that has no one seen before.

This video course starts by explaining the organizational alignment that has to happen in every company that wants to implement DevOps in order to be effective. 

We delve into deploying and managing applications on Kubernetes, but we also take a look at how Docker Swarm works. We also explore how to create a continuous delivery pipeline and deploy a microservice-based system to update it, keeping all the lights on.
We will review some tools for monitoring software, but our focus will be on Stackdriver, as this monitoring solution from Google Cloud Platform provides us (out of the box) with a fairly comprehensive set of tools to deal with the flaws in our systems.
